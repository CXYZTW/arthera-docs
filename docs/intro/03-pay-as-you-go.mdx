The Pay-as-You-Go mode is the standard operating mode of Arthera for accounts that don't have an active subscription or for which
their subscription reached its cap.

Every transaction will incur gas costs for the sender, which means the sender needs to have a positive balance of AA in his wallet,
otherwise the transaction will be reverted.

## Gas fee rebates
Every contract account on Arthera can opt-in for gas-fee rebates by registering their address and a fee receiver account
in a special system contract.

The registered fee receiver **will get 10% of the gas fees** spent by EOAs that send transactions to the registered contract account.
