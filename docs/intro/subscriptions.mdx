Subscription business models are based on the idea of selling a product or service to receive monthly or yearly recurring subscription revenue.
They focus on customer retention over customer acquisition. In essence, subscription business models focus on the way revenue is made so that
a single customer pays multiple payments for prolonged access to a service instead of a large upfront one-time price.

The economy is trending toward more subscriptions instead of ownership for cars, software, entertainment, and shopping.
This increases the lifetime value (LTV) of the customer.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis.
SaaS apps are typically accessed by users of a web browser (a thin client) and it quickly became the preferred business model for all tech startups.

The current Web 3.0 environment make subscriptions difficult to implement without relying on a central authority,
because smart contracts don't have the ability to schedule execution in an automated way. This is intentional and by design.

## The Arthera model
Arthera is implementing several changes to the gas fee system. Arthera users can have their gas fees waived by having an active subscription or using a DApp that has an active subscription.
These subscriptions are built into the core protocol. To fully comprehend how they function, we must first define two types of users:

- **Subscribers** These users pay in advance at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.) and use the blockchain without any fees within the bounds of their subscription plan. There are two types of subscribers:
    - _DApps_ These users can waive gas fees for their customers, providing them with flexible, recurring revenue models that do not rely on cryptocurrency
    - _End-Users_ These users do not wish to be concerned with owning cryptocurrency or paying gas fees.
- **Pay-as-You-Go** These users and DApps function in the conventional way, using cryptocurrency to pay for gas fees for each transaction. In Arthera, Pay-as-You-Go gas fees are also allocated to DApps, incentivizing the entire ecosystem, not just validators.
