Subscription business models are based on the idea of selling a product or service to receive monthly or yearly recurring subscription revenue.
They focus on customer retention over customer acquisition. In essence, subscription business models focus on the way revenue is made so that
a single customer pays multiple payments for prolonged access to a service instead of a large upfront one-time price.

The economy is trending toward more subscriptions instead of ownership for cars, software, entertainment, and shopping.
This increases the lifetime value (LTV) of the customer.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis.
SaaS apps are typically accessed by users of a web browser (a thin client) and it quickly became the preferred business model for all tech startups.

The current Web 3.0 environment make subscriptions difficult to implement without relying on a central authority,
because smart contracts don't have the ability to schedule execution in an automated way. This is intentional and by design.

## The Arthera model
Arthera introduces a number of changes on how gas fees work. An Arthera user can have his gas fees waived if that user has an active subscription or if he uses a DApp that has an active subscription.
Subscriptions embedded in the core protocol. To understand how they work, we need to define first two types of users:

- **Subscribers** who pay something in advance, at regular intervals (monthy, quarterly, yearly etc.) and use the blockchain with no fees within the boundaries of their subscription plan. There are two types of subscribers:
    - _DApps_ that want to have predictable costs and waive gas fees for their users, allowing them to build flexible, recurrent revenue models that don't need to rely on a cryptocurrency
    - _End-Users_ that don't want to worry about owning cryptocurrencies or paying gas fees
- **Pay-as-You-Go** users and DApps that work in the traditional way, using a cryptocurrency to paying gas fees for every transaction. In Arthera, Pay-as-You-Go gas fees are distributed to DApps as well, to incetivize the entire ecosystem, not just validators.
