Web 3.0, which refers to the next generation of the Internet that is based on decentralized technologies,
has not yet achieved mass adoption for several reasons:

- **Complexity**: Web3 technologies are still relatively complex, requiring a certain level of technical expertise to use and understand.
This complexity can be a barrier to entry for many users.
- **Limited Applications**: While there are many promising use cases for Web3 technologies, their practical
applications are still relatively limited compared to traditional web technologies. This limits their appeal to a
broader audience.
- **Infrastructure**: The infrastructure required to support Web3 technologies is still underdeveloped, making it
challenging to build and scale decentralized applications.
- **User Experience**: The user experience of Web3 technologies is still not as smooth and intuitive as traditional web
technologies. This can be a barrier to adoption for users who are not familiar with blockchain technology.
- **Volatility**: The high volatility of cryptocurrencies is a significant obstacle to their widespread adoption,
making them less reliable for most business models.
- **Regulatory Environment**: The regulatory environment surrounding Web3 technologies is still uncertain and complex,
which can discourage businesses and investors from getting involved.

Overall, while Web3 has the potential to revolutionize the internet as we know it, its mass adoption will depend on
overcoming these barriers and making the technology more accessible and user-friendly for mainstream users.

## Arthera

Arthera is a new type of decentralized economy designed to remove all barriers to Web 3.0 mass adoption.
We aim to change the way individuals and businesses engage with blockchain technology through a fresh, new perspective,
enabling new business models, better use cases and streamlined user journeys by:
- Introducing fixed-price monthly subscriptions to eliminate concerns about network fees for users and businesses
- Enabling DApps to pay for their users' network fees, paving the way for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business models
- Sharing network fees across the ecosystem with both validators and DApps
- Making it possible for Web 2.0 users to use the Arthera blockchain through well-established payment and authentication methods.
- Enabling Web 2.0 businesses to incorporate blockchain technology into their products without having to worry about network fees, cryptocurrencies, and price volatility
- Running our operations on a highly-scalable, cutting-edge L1 chain that employs horizontal scalability and a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based mempool, allowing it to handle millions of transactions.

With Arthera, there is a paradigm shift away from token-based business models and individual transaction fees towards a subscription-based approach.
This model allows DApps to flourish based on their genuine value proposition, enabling them to concentrate on acquiring and retaining users.
This results in a thriving ecosystem where quality takes precedence over quantity.

## Actors
Arthera has two types of actors that interact with the network:

- **Subscribers** that pay a subscription fee at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.) and use the blockchain without any gas costs within the bounds of their subscription plan. There are two types of subscribers:

  - _Contracts (aka DApps)_ - subscribe to Arthera to waive gas fees for their customers, allowing for new business models that don't rely on their customers owning cryptocurrency, massively increasing adoption by:
    - creating tailored subscriptions or one-off payments specific to their business model, without worrying about their cusomers' gas fees or owning cryptocurrency.
    - accepting any payment method from its customers in fiat money, cypto
    - onboarding customers that have no knowledge of crypto, blockchains
    - completely reducing fraud, lost keys and scams
    - focusing on the real business value of their product and customer retention
  - _Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) (aka End-Users)_ subcribe to Arthera to forget about gas fees or owning cryptocurrency.

- **Pay-as-You-Go** that work with Arthera in the conventional way, using cryptocurrencies and paying gas fees for each transaction.
