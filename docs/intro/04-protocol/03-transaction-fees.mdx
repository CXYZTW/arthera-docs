title: Transaction Fees
---
Each transaction on Artera requires a transaction fee paid to the network in order to prevent spam attacks.
The fee is paid in Arhtera's native token AA.

## Gas Price
Arthera follows the traditional model where gas price is adjusted based on network congestion.
Gas price is represented in Gwei, where 1 Gwei = 0.000000001 AA.

Different types of transactions have different gas limits depending on their complexity;
a simple AA transfer, for example, costs less in Gas than executing a complicated smart contract transaction.

While the amount of Gas required for a transaction, remains constant, the Gas price is dynamic and is adjusted automatically
according to network congestion.

To understand how prices fluctuate, consider that:
- there is a base fee for transactions which is the minimum for every transaction
- the average gas spent per second over periods of time is monitored by the protocol. When network traffic increases,
the system increases the base fee to reflect the new demand.

Every EVM blockchain needs to throttle Gas supply by increasing gas prices. Consider that a new node that has to
sync with the entire chain. If the chain grows at maximum speed, syncing will never complete since the chain will
grow faster than a node can sync. Raising prices normalizes network traffic by lowering demand.

To mitigate gas price volatility, Arthera has a custom version of EIP-1559 that includes a fee balancer and
a maximum allowable Gas consumption of 10 Million gas units/second at moments of high network congestion.
As a consequence, users no longer need to overbid on gas prices when submitting a transaction.

## Rewards distribution
30% of transaction fees are burned. The remaining 70% of transaction fees are distributed between validators
proportional to their transactions reward weight.
