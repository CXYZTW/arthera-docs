title: Consensus

## Stage 1 (current)
Arthera's Stage 1 Consensus is based on the Lachesis open-source software library.
Lachesis is designed to easily plug into any blockchain node written in Golang, or in any other language if provided
with a wrapper. Basically, Lachesis process consensus messages from other nodes and guarantee that everyone processes
the same commands in the same order. To do this, it uses a DAG aBFT consensus algorithm.

Lachesis is:

- Asynchronous: Participants have the freedom to process commands at different times.
- Leaderless: No participant plays a 'special' role.
- Byzantine Fault-Tolerant: Supports one third of faulty nodes, including malicious behavior.
- Final: Lachesis's output can be used immediately, no need for block confirmations, etc.

Lachesis is a DAG-based aBFT consensus protocol with guaranteed finality. The Lachesis protocol is leaderless
achieving complete asynchrony, no round robin and no proof-of-work. Every confirmed transaction is final, unless more
than 1/3W of validators are Byzantine.

Each Lachesis node stores a local acyclic directed graph (DAG) composed of event blocks, each of which contains
transactions. In this wiki, the terms 'event' and 'event block' are sometimes used interchangebly. The DAG capturing
the happens-before relationship between the events is used to calculate an exact final order of events (and hence transactions)
independently on each node.

Events are divided into confirmed and unconfirmed events. New events are unconfirmed, whilst usually events
from past 2-3+ frames are all confirmed. For confirmed events, honest nodes can compute their exact order.
Unconfirmed events can only be partially ordered.

Consensus results into batches of confirmed events, where each batch of events is called a block.
Blocks (or finalized blocks) forming the final chain are calculated from event blocks independently on each node.
Unlike PoW, round-robin PoS, coinage PoS and sync BFT, nodes don't send blocks to each other. Only events are
being synced between nodes. Validators of the network do not vote on a concrete state of the network, but instead
they periodically exchange transactions and events they observe with peers.

Unlike sync BFT (like pBFT), Lachesis do not use new events in current election, but instead they are used to vote for
the events in 2-3+ previous virtual elections simultaneously. This leads to a smaller number of created consensus messages,
as the same event is reused in different elections. Hence, Lachesis achieves a lower TTF and a smaller consensus overhead
comparing to sync BFT.

You can read more about Lachesis in the [academic paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01900).

## Stage 2 (future)
Arthera's Stage 2 Final chain will use its own BlazeDAG mempool and zero-message consensus.
When Stage 2 will go live, Arthera will be able to scale with no limits due to changes in the node's architecture and
EVM parallelization features, achieving record TPS numbers and fast block finality.
