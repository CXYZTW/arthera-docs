Introduction to the Arthera protocol, its implementation details, and the relationship to Ethereum.

## What is the Arthera Protocol?
Arthera's blockchain is a DAG-based blockchain that is fully EVM-compatible. Its implementation started from go-ethereum,
the Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol, but with a different consensus engine and operating model,
aimed at high transaction volumes, fast confirmation times and low gas fees.

The protocol is designed to go live in two stages:
- **Stage 1**: the Beacon chain based on a leaderless, scalable, asynchronous BFT that uses DAG streams.
The purpose of the Beacon chain is to kickstart the ecosystem.
- **Stage 2**: the Final chain that will use a proprietary DAG-based mempool and zero-message consensus.
When Stage 2 will go live, Arthera will be able to scale with no limits due to changes in the node's architecture and
EVM parallelization features, achieving record TPS numbers and fast block finality.

In addition to the blockchain node, some core components of the protocol are implemented in smart contract level
and even off-chain (e.g. price oracles or phone number verification via SMS).


### Epochs
The protocol is organized in Epochs comprised of a number of (finalized) blocks. Each epoch is sealed when one of
the below conditions is satisfied:

- a maximum threshold of gas power was spent
- the epoch's duration is finished
- at least one dishonest validator is confirmed in the current block
- on-request

The lowest possible epoch number is 1.
