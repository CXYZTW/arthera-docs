title: "Proof of Stake"
---

Arthera's proof-of-stake consensus is the set of processes that determine which nodes become validators and how
incentives are distributed to secure the network.

Validator nodes are responsible for generating and validating blocks. In return they will receive block rewards
and a percentage of transaction fees and subscription fees. Based on their performance and reputation, validator nodes
are assigned a score. They are incentivized to act in accordance with the network because they are subject to
penalization (slashing) if they behave maliciously.

## Staking and Delegation
Users will be able delegate a portion of their tokens to validating nodes. Validators will not be able to spend
delegated tokens, which will remain secured in the userâ€™s own address. Validators will receive a fixed proportion
of the validator fees attributable to delegators.  They will therefore compete based on their performance and not on fees.
Higher performing node, with more reliable uptimes, will earn higher returns. Delegators will be incentivised to choose
nodes that have a high validator score, i.e. are reliable and high performing.


## Validator Rewards
A validator's reward is weighted by 2 independent numbers:
- `transactions reward weight`: share of transaction fees the validator will receive at the end of epoch.
- `base reward weight`: share of base reward (newly minted coins) the validator will receive at the end of epoch.

Reward weights are calculated at the end of each epoch using the formulas below:
- `transactions reward weight = originated fee * uptime`
- `base reward weight = stake * (uptime ^ 2)`

where:
- `stake` is the sum of delegations to validator (including validator's self-delegation)
- `uptime` is the total number of nanoseconds the validator was online in the epoch. It's also called the validation score.
- `originated fee` is the total fees of transactions that the validator originated in the epoch ("originated" means "included into event"). It's also called origination score.

A list of properties which may be concluded from formulas:
- `originated fee` may be roughly estimated as `stake share * uptime * network fee per nanosecond`.
If we substitute estimation into transactions reward weight formula, then we'll get
`(stake share * uptime * network fee per nanosecond) * uptime`.
- `uptime` influences the reward in a non-linear way. If a validator has 50% uptime in epoch, he'll
receive approx. 4 times smaller rewards in that epoch.
- `stake` influences base reward linearly, and influences transactions reward weight linearly on average.

## Rewards distribution
Validator rewards are split in three parts:
- `base rewards`, calculated as `epoch duration in second * base reward per second`, are inflationary rewards given
by the protocol to hones validators, proportional to their `base reward weight`
- `transaction rewards` are rewards from transaction fees. The protocol burns 30% of transaction fees.
70% of burnt fees plus 70% of the remaining total transaction fees are distributed to validators according
to their `transactions reward weight`
- `subscription rewards` are rewards from subscription fees. All subscription fees in an epoch are distributed
to validators according to their `transactions reward weight`

Delegators receive rewards according to their stake and will pay a 15% commission to the validator for their rewards.

### Downtime
Downtime is calculated as a difference time of `last block-time of last block where validator had at least 1 event`.
Downtime has 2 numbers: `number of missed blocks` and `time of missed blocks`. If validator missed not more than 50 blocks,
then downtime should be interpreted as 0, because it may be possible that validator has a right to emit events slower
than other validators.
Uptime in an epoch is calculated differently. It's reset to 0 every epoch, and during processing of i'th block,
uptime is incremented by `block[i].time-block[i - min(number of missed blocks, 50)].time`.

According to the formulas above, missing of no more than 50 blocks in a raw doesn't affect uptime.

If validator has downtime >= 72 hours (but not less than 1000 blocks), then he's permanently pruned from
validators list. In this case, validator and delegators have to withdraw their stake via the Staking contract using
the withdrawal procedure.
