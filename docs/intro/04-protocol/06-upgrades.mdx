Network upgrade (hard fork) may involve rule changes such that the software validating according to the old rules
will see the events produced according to the new rules as invalid. In case of a network upgrade, all nodes
meant to work in accordance with the new rules need to upgrade their software.

In a case of a network upgrade, it's important to upgrade the node before the network upgrade is activated.
If node was upgraded after the network upgrade was activated, then node's state becomes dirty - in this case,
a full re-sync is required. The state will become dirty because the outdated node will process new blocks/events
according to the old rules, differently to the upgraded nodes.

The Arthera node software tracks current network version by listening on-chain events.

By default, the node will show warning in a case of a network upgrade was activated before current node has upgraded to a latest version:

<Alert severity='warning'>
    WARN [...] Network upgrade y.y.y was activated. Current node version is x.x.x. Please upgrade your node and re-sync chain data.
</Alert>
<br/>

If you miss an upgrade, your node will become dirty and will need to be re-synced. The following warning will be displayed:
<Alert severity='error'>
    WARN [...] Node's state is dirty because node was upgraded after the network upgrade y.y.y was activated. Please re-sync the chain data to continue.
</Alert>
