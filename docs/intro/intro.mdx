Web 3.0, which refers to the next generation of the Internet that is based on decentralized technologies, has not yet achieved mass adoption for several reasons:

- **Complexity**: Web3 technologies are still relatively complex, requiring a certain level of technical expertise to use and understand. This complexity can be a barrier to entry for many users.
- **Limited Applications**: While there are many promising use cases for Web3 technologies, their practical applications are still relatively limited compared to traditional web technologies. This limits their appeal to a broader audience.
- **Infrastructure**: The infrastructure required to support Web3 technologies is still underdeveloped, making it challenging to build and scale decentralized applications.
- **User Experience**: The user experience of Web3 technologies is still not as smooth and intuitive as traditional web technologies. This can be a barrier to adoption for users who are not familiar with blockchain technology.
- **Volatility**: The high volatility of cryptocurrencies is a significant obstacle to their widespread adoption, making them less reliable for most business models.
- **Regulatory Environment**: The regulatory environment surrounding Web3 technologies is still uncertain and complex, which can discourage businesses and investors from getting involved.

Overall, while Web3 has the potential to revolutionize the internet as we know it, its mass adoption will depend on overcoming these barriers and making the technology more accessible and user-friendly for mainstream users.

## Arthera
Arthera is a new type of decentralized economy designed to remove all barriers to Web 3.0 mass adoption.
We aim to change the way individuals and businesses engage with blockchain technology through a fresh, new perspective,
enabling new business models, better use cases and streamlined user journeys by:
- introducing fixed-price monthly subscriptions so users and businesses don't worry about network fees
- allowing DApps to pay for their user's network fees and transition to a SaaS-based business model
- sharing network fees with the entire ecosystem, both validators and DApps
- allowing Web 2.0 users to use the Arthera blockchain using well-established methods of payment and authentication
- allowing Web 2.0 businesses to integrate blockchain technology in their products without worrying about network fees, cryptocurrencies and price volatility
- running everything on a highly-scalable, new generation L1 chain that can handle millions of transactions through horizontal scalability and a DAG-based mempool

Arthera introduces a new paradigm, shifting the focus from token-based business models and discrete transaction fees to a subscription-based model where DApps thrive based on their
real added value, allowing them to focus on user acquisition and user retention. This translates in a healthy ecosystem, where quality supersedes quantity.
