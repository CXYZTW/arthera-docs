Arthera is an EVM blockchain that is compatible with most [EVM-compatible wallets](/learn/other-wallets). You can safely use any compatible wallet to perform basic tasks like sending/receiving coins, tokens and NFTs.

Here are some tutorials on how to configure existing wallets to work with Arthera:

## Metamask
You can use MetaMask to interact with Arthera. You just need to add the Arthera TestNet to the list of supported networks in MetaMask.
Here's how you can add the Artera TestNet to MetaMask:

1. **Open MetaMask:**
Launch the MetaMask extension in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or Edge). If you haven't installed MetaMask yet, you can download it from the official [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/download/).

2. **Log in to your account:**
If you're not logged in already, enter your password and log in to your MetaMask account.

3. **Add Arthera Testnet to Metamask**: <AddMetamaskNetwork network={'testnet'} title={'Add it now'}  size={'small'}/> or add it manually using the steps below:

    3.1. **Access the network menu:**
    In the MetaMask extension window, click the dropdown menu at the top of the screen, where it shows the current network you're connected to (e.g., "Ethereum Mainnet").

    3.2. **Add a new network:** Scroll down to the bottom of the network list and click on "Add network"

    3.3. **Enter network details:** You'll be presented with a form to enter the details of the new network. Fill in the fields with the appropriate information:
    * Network Name: `Arthera TestNet`
    * New RPC URL: `https://rpc-test.arthera.net`
    * Chain ID: `10243`
    * Symbol (optional): `AA`
    * Block Explorer URL (optional): `https://explorer-test.arthera.net`

   3.4. **Save the network:** After filling in the required information, click "Save" to add the new network to your MetaMask.

4. **Connect to the new network:** Once the network is added, it will be available in the network dropdown menu. Click on the new network's name to connect to it.

Now your MetaMask wallet is connected to the new network, and you can interact with smart contracts and dApps on Arthera TestNet using your MetaMask account.
Remember that each network has its own set of tokens, so your balances may be different across networks.
