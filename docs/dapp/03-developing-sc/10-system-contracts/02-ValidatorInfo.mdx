Arthera has a number of system contracts that perform various protocol-level tasks. The choice to decouple some
functionality form the main blockchain node to system contract is related to upgradeability.
All System Contracts are upgradeble through a governance process, so if a vote is cast through governance
to change the price of subscription plans or staking rewards, a new version of the respective contracts will be deployed
without having validators upgrade their software or restart their node.

This contract is responsible for keeping a mapping between validator addresses and a validator JSON info file with
additional information about the validator. The JSON file needs to be publicly available at an URl and has the
following format:

```json
{
  "name": "demo validator",
  "logoUrl": "https://imgur.net/validator_logo.png",
  "website": "https://validator.website",
  "contact": "contact@validator.website"
}
```

You can use the [Arthera's public validator registry](https://github.com/artheranet/validator-registry) to publish
your JSON file in Arthera's validator registry repository.
