Arthera has a number of system contracts that perform various protocol-level tasks. The choice to decouple some
functionality form the main blockchain node to system contract is related to upgradeability.
All System Contracts are upgradeble through a governance process, so if a vote is cast through governance
to change the price of subscription plans or staking rewards, a new version of the respective contracts will be deployed
without having validators upgrade their software or restart their node.
