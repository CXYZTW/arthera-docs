Introduction to the Arthera protocol, its implementation details, and the relationship to Ethereum.

## What is the Arthera Protocol?
Arthera's blockchain is a DAG-based blockchain that is fully EVM-compatible. Its implementation started from go-ethereum,
the Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol, but with a different consensus engine and operating model,
aimed at high transaction volumes, fast confirmation times and low gas fees.

The protocol is designed to go live in two stages:
- **Stage 1**: the Beacon chain based on a leaderless, scalable, asynchronous BFT that uses DAG streams.
The purpose of the Beacon chain is to kickstart the ecosystem.
- **Stage 2**: the Final chain that will use a proprietary DAG-based mempool and zero-message consensus.
When Stage 2 will go live, Arthera will be able to scale with no limits due to changes in the node's architecture and
EVM parallelization features, achieving record TPS numbers and fast block finality.

The protocol
In addition to the blockchain node, some core components of the protocol are implemented in smart contract level
and even off-chain (e.g. price oracles or phone number verification via SMS).


## Proof of Stake for Stage 1
Arthera's proof-of-stake consensus is the set of processes that determine which nodes become validators and how
incentives are distributed to secure the network.

AA coins will have multiple uses in the Arthera ecosystem, one of these being the right to stake and delegate them to
validators. When staking or delegating AA coins a userâ€™s weight will be determined not only by the number of AA coins held,
but also by the gas spend within a 30-day period.

Validator nodes are responsible for generating and validating blocks. In return they will receive block rewards
and a percentage of transaction fees and subscription fees. Based on their performance and reputation, validator nodes
are assigned a score. They are incentivized to act in accordance with the network because they are subject to
penalization (slashing) if they behave maliciously.
