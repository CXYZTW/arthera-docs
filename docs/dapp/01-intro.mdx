Arthera is an L1 blockchain that provides full EVM support. For developers, this means that building on Arthera is the same as building on Ethereum.
Contracts that work on Ethereum or other EVM-compatible blockchains should work on Arthera with minimal or no changes.

## Architecture
The architecture of Arthera has three major components:

### Arthera Blockchain
An open cryptographic protocol that allows applications to make transactions with and run smart contracts in a secure
and decentralized way. The Arthera blockchain has a lot in common with Ethereum and maintains full EVM compatibility
for smart contracts. However, it uses an Asynchronous DAG-based Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism
(Proof-of-Stake) and has different block format, transaction format, client synchronization protocols,
and gas payment and pricing mechanisms.

### Core System Contracts
A set of smart contracts running on the Arthera blockchain that include much of the logic of the platform features
including subscriptions, identities, proof-of-stake, and governance. These Core System Contracts are upgradeable
and managed by a decentralized governance process.

### Applications
Applications or DApps built on Arthera either by Arthera itself or by developers using the available Arthera SDKs.
A number of pre-built applications needed to operate the network are available or currently in construction:
- _Arthera Wallet_ - a mobile-compatible web application where users manage their account on the Arthera network
- _Arthera Explorer_ - the official blockchain explorer
- _Arthera Launchpad_ - a service platform for startups where
- _Arthera Store_ - store for DApps and subscriptions
- _Arthera Connect_ - a place where ecosystem builders meet, discuss, exchange ideas and partner
- _Arthera Governance_ - where protocol decisions are made through a decentralized governance model

### Validators
Validators gather and execute transactions received from other nodes along with smart contract code to form new blocks,
then participate in the Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol to advance the state of the network.
