This can be useful, for instance, to show the invoices directly to your customer on the billing section of your website.
This document explains how to configure custom invoice templates.

Arthera SMP uses the [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) engine for generating HTML content.

The template needs to be a standalone HTML document that has Mustache directives and placeholders for various variables that Arthera will fill automatically.
Because the template must be a standalone HTML document, you need to embed all CSS styles in the HTML and insert images either as Base64 `data` elements or by using external links.

### Invoice Template
Arthera SMP provides the following variables to the invoice HTML template:
