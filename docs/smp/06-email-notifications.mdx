Arthera SMP can send email notifications when certain events occur:

- **INVOICE_CREATION**: The customer will receive an email informing them that a new invoice is available.
- **INVOICE_NOTIFICATION**: The customer will receive an email about upcoming invoices
- **INVOICE_PAYMENT_SUCCESS**: The customer will receive an email after each successful payment or refund.
- **INVOICE_PAYMENT_FAILED**: The customer will receive an email after each failed payment.
- **SUBSCRIPTION_CANCEL**: The customer will receive an email at the time a subscription was requested to be canceled and/or at the effective date of the subscription cancellation.

### Email Templates
Every time Arthera send a notification email, it will use the configured template for each notification type.
Arthera SMP uses the [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) engine for generating HTML content.

The templates need to be standalone HTML documents that have Mustache directives and placeholders for various variables that Arthera will fill automatically.
Because the template must be a standalone HTML document, you need to embed all CSS styles in the HTML and insert images either as Base64 `data` elements or by using external links.

Arthera SMP provides the following variables to the email HTML templates:
