The [**Shock Arthera**](https://medium.com/arthera/were-preparing-to-shock-arthera-with-a-testnet-validator-program-cfcf9904cc94) validator program acts as the essential electric shocks that infuse life into the system, guaranteeing seamless operations and establishing a foundation of strength, resilience, and reliability. Its pivotal role is to propel the system towards the Mainnet, ensuring smooth functionality and setting the stage for a flourishing and enduring ecosystem.

It's a permissionless network dedicated to validators that were selected as part of the registration process.

Program Objectives
- Simulating a working ecosystem
- Stress-testing the network
- Selecting trusted validators
