The [**Shock Arthera**](https://medium.com/arthera/were-preparing-to-shock-arthera-with-a-testnet-validator-program-cfcf9904cc94) validator program acts as the essential electric shocks that infuse life into the system, guaranteeing seamless operations and establishing a foundation of strength, resilience, and reliability. Its pivotal role is to propel the system towards the Mainnet, ensuring smooth functionality and setting the stage for a flourishing and enduring ecosystem.

It's a permissionless network dedicated to validators that were selected as part of the registration process.

Program Objectives
- Simulating a working ecosystem
- Stress-testing the network
- Selecting trusted validators

<Alert severity='error'>
    <strong>This network is dedicated to the Shock Arthera Validator Program. Don't use it for development purposes.</strong> <br/>
    This network will be reset frequently and it will have periods of instability as we run various test scenarios.
</Alert>

## Running a validator node

### 1. Get a machine that meets the following requirements:
- CPU: 4 cores / 8 threads, 2.6GHz, or faster
- RAM: 8GB or more
- Disk: 500GB of SSD storage or more
- Network: 1GBps, Public IP

### 2. Install Docker
See the [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## 3. Pull the latest Arthera node image
```bash
docker pull arthera/arthera-node:latest
```

## 4. Create a folder to hold your Arthera node data
```bash
mkdir $HOME/arthera
```

## 5. Create a wallet for your validator
```bash
docker run -it -v $HOME/arthera:/data arthera/arthera-node:latest account new
```
Enter a password for the new account and you will get an output similar to the one below:
```
Your new key was generated

Public address of the key:   0x0bEdA7aAB9cFAa963443e27e30a8F04A79f099C3
Path of the secret key file: /data/keystore/UTC--2023-07-18T21-48-46.572871703Z--088dc563b8184107010c947c4b94bbc856992985

- You can share your public address with anyone. Others need it to interact with you.
- You must NEVER share the secret key with anyone! The key controls access to your funds!
- You must BACKUP your key file! Without the key, it's impossible to access account funds!
- You must REMEMBER your password! Without the password, it's impossible to decrypt the key!
```

<Alert severity='error'>
    1. Copy the generated secret key file from <strong>$HOME/arthera/keystore/UTC-****</strong> to your workstation. You will need it later on. <br/>
    2. Remember the password
</Alert>

## 6. Fund your validator wallet
Fund your validator wallet with at least 100,001 AA coins.

## 7. Create the validator identity
```bash
docker run -it -v $HOME/arthera:/data arthera/arthera-node:latest validator new
```
Enter a password for the validator account and you will get an output similar to the one below:
```
Your new key was generated

Public key: 		0xc004c1edab0ed2b77a316c81114177bb071bbc94ec2674a3ccb42c59fe539dd301c1868b919a7cd208d1e8798af141cf2fc41994c35cf4dfc3dd7df74f431f086022
   Address: 		0xcF95c3A3DBe170caF1CCf9c8E02C70D4a1E72a2a
Path of the secret key file: /data/keystore/validator/c004c1edab0ed2b77a316c81114177bb071bbc94ec2674a3ccb42c59fe539dd301c1868b919a7cd208d1e8798af141cf2fc41994c35cf4dfc3dd7df74f431f086022

- You can share your public key with anyone. Others need it to validate messages from you.
- You must NEVER share the secret key with anyone! The key controls access to your validator!
- You must BACKUP your key file! Without the key, it's impossible to operate the validator!
- You must REMEMBER your password! Without the password, it's impossible to decrypt the key!
```

<Alert severity='error'>
    1. Copy the validator's <strong>Public key</strong> displayed above <br/>
    2. Remember the password
</Alert>

## 8. Register your validator
You need the [Arthera wallet](https://wallet-test.arthera.net) to register you validator:

1. Configure MetaMask to connect to the Arthera Devnet (see [Network details](#network-details))
2. Import you wallet private key created in step [5. Create a wallet for your validator](#5-create-a-wallet-for-your-validator) into Metamask
3. Go to [`https://wallet-dev.arthera.net`](https://wallet-dev.arthera.net)
4. Login with Metamask and select the imported account
5. In the Arthera Wallet select the `Account` menu item
6. Under the **Become a Validator** section enter you validator Public Key generated in step [7. Create the validator identity](#7-create-the-validator-identity)
7. Click **Register**

**If successful, you validator `ID` will be displayed.**

## 9. Create a password file
Run the command below and replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with the password entered in step [7. Create the validator identity](#7-create-the-validator-identity)
```bash
echo "YOUR_PASSWORD" > $HOME/arthera/password
```

## 10. Generate your node key
Run the command below and replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with the password entered in step [7. Create the validator identity](#7-create-the-validator-identity)
```bash
docker run -it -v $HOME/arthera:/data arthera/arthera-node:latest p2p genkey /data/node.key
```

## 11. Download the latest Devnet genesis file
Run the command below to download the `devnet.g` genesis file:
```bash
curl -o $HOME/arthera/devnet.g http://release.arthera.net/devnet.g
```

## 12. Test your node
Replace the following variables and run the command below to start your validator:

- `YOUR_PUBLIC_IP` with your actual Public IP address.
- `ID_FROM_STEP_8` with the Validator ID obtained from step [8. Register your validator](#7-create-the-validator-identity)
- `VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_STEP_7` with the **Public key** of your validator from step [7. Create the validator identity](#7-create-the-validator-identity)

```bash
docker pull arthera/arthera-node:latest
docker run -v $HOME/arthera:/data arthera/arthera-node:latest -p 6535:6060 -p 18545:18545 -p 18546:18546 \
  --nodekey=/data/node.key \
  --metrics --verbosity=4 \
  --nat=extip:YOUR_PUBLIC_IP \
  --validator.id ID_FROM_STEP_8 \
  --validator.pubkey="VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_STEP_7" \
  --validator.password="/data/password"
```

If you get messages like `New event` and `New block` it means your node is syncing and working properly.

Check the [Metrics Dashboard](https://metrics.arthera.net/d/de1a140f-ba0d-47b4-9ff1-697f5b018f1d) to see if your node is listed and has statistics available.
Choose your validator node from the dropdown list. The validator id displayed in the dropdown list is actually your node id from the `$HOME/arthera/node.key` file formatted like `<first 4 chars><middle 4 chars><last 4 chars>`

<img src="/img/metrics.png" alt="Metrics Dashboard" width="800"/>
<p/>

You can now stop the node with `Ctrl+C`, clean the output folder with `rm -rf $HOME/arthera/arthera-node $HOME/arthera/chaindata` and move to the next step.

## 13. Run your node
Replace the following variables and run the command below to start your validator:

- `YOUR_PUBLIC_IP` with your actual Public IP address.
- `ID_FROM_STEP_8` with the Validator ID obtained from step [8. Register your validator](#7-create-the-validator-identity)
- `VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_STEP_7` with the **Public key** of your validator from step [7. Create the validator identity](#7-create-the-validator-identity)

```bash
docker pull arthera/arthera-node:latest
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 6535:6060 -p 18545:18545 -p 18546:18546 \
  -v $HOME/arthera:/data arthera/arthera-node:latest \
  --nodekey /data/node.key \
  --metrics \
  --nat extip:YOUR_PUBLIC_IP \
  --validator.id ID_FROM_STEP_8 \
  --validator.pubkey "VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_STEP_7" \
  --validator.password "/data/password"
```

## Troubleshooting

#### 1. Node is not syncing
The most common problems are firewalls and incorrectly provided external IP address.

#### 2. Database is corrupted
Remove the database with `rm -rf $HOME/arthera/arthera-node $HOME/arthera/chaindata` and start your node to re-sync again.
