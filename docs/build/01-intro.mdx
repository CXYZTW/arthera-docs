Arthera is an L1 blockchain that provides full EVM support. For developers, this means that building on Arthera is the same as building on Ethereum. Contracts that work on Ethereum or other EVM-compatible blockchains should work on Arthera with minimal or no changes.

Before diving into in-depth development on the Arthera blockchain, we recommend starting with these tutorials if you're new to our platform. They serve as a helpful introduction to developing for the Arthera blockchain and will assist you in the development process.
