Contracts that work on EVM-compatible blockchains should work on Arthera with minimal or no changes.
You can use your preferred EVM tools and libraries to start developing on Arthera:
- [**Hardhat**](https://hardhat.org/)
- [**Truffle**](https://trufflesuite.com/)
- [**Alchemy**](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart)
- [**Remix**](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

Arthera is also fully compatible with [**OpenZeppelin**](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/) libraries.
