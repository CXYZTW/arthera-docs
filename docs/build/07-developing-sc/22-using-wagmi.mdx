description: Learn how to configure Wagmi for Arthera

[**Wagmi**](https://wagmi.sh/) is a popular React Hooks library for Ethereum.
To work with a local Arthera node or with the Arthera TestNet, Wagmi needs to know how to connect to the respective network.

## Arthera Testnet

Add the following snippet in a `artheraTestnet.ts` file to import it in your Wagmi configuration of custom chains.

```js
import { Chain } from "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit";

export const artheraTestnet: Chain = {
  id: 10243,
  name: "artheraTestnet",
  iconUrl: "/arthera.svg",
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: 18,
    name: "Arthera",
    symbol: "AA",
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    public: { http: ["https://rpc-test.arthera.net"] },
    default: { http: ["https://rpc-test.arthera.net"] },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    etherscan: { name: "Arthera Testnet Scan", url: "https://explorer-test.arthera.net" },
    default: { name: "Arthera Testnet Scan", url: "https://explorer-test.arthera.net" },
  },
  testnet: true,
};
```

## Arthera Mainnet

Add the following snippet in a `arthera.ts` file to import it in your Wagmi configuration of custom chains.

```js
import { Chain } from "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit";

export const arthera: Chain = {
  id: 10242,
  name: "arthera",
  iconUrl: "/arthera.svg",
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: 18,
    name: "AA",
    symbol: "AA",
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    public: { http: ["https://rpc.arthera.net"] },
    default: { http: ["https://rpc.arthera.net"] },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    etherscan: { name: "Arthera Mainnet Scan", url: "https://explorer.arthera.net/" },
    default: { name: "Arthera Mainnet Scan", url: "https://explorer.arthera.net/" },
  },
};
```
